This document shows how to open a TCP port on firewalld (using a service instead of explicitly opening the port)

# Add express_app.xml to /usr/lib/firewalld/services/
sudo cp express_app.xml /usr/lib/firewalld/services/

# This directory is where the service definitions for firewalld are stored. express_app.xml
# Simply specifies the port 3000 (via TCP) with some meta data so that we remember what the port is used for

# Reload firewall rules to make express_app service visible:
sudo firewall-cmd --reload

# Check if express_app service is available 
sudo firewall-cmd --get-services

# Add the express_app service (--permanent should be added after the configuration is tested, via curl or otherwise)
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=express_app --permanent

# List services of zone to confirm express_app was added. 
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-services

# Restart firewalld
sudo systemctl restart firewalld
